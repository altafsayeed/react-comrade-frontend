Front end code for React social media app.

Live app: https://gamebuddy-d773f.web.app/

Comrade is a social media app hypothetically intended to help gamers find teammates to play video games with. This is my largest project and its main purpose was for me to learn app development with React. Building this app introduced me to back-end development using Firebase and Postman to create CRUD operations, handle authentication, authorization, errors, storage, and other functions. It also gave me a solid understanding of front-end development using React and Redux.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
React
JavaScript
Node.js
Redux
Firebase (cloud database/functions/storage, authentication, and hosting)
Postman (Used to run API requests to test API)
Express
Material-UI
